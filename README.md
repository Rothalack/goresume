**smol todos**
Dark/Light mode?
Get all raid images. Write a scrapper? I don't know how I would do that because the images I've gotten so far have come from official blizzard press release material and it's consistent. Maybe get images from wowhead, which could be more orderly

**BIG TODOs**

**Login and account system**

**logging/error logging**
Something to compile errors and logs into somewhere searchable. Prometheus+Grafana?

**CI/CD Release System**
Simple and just have releases set up on github?
Go full, have release commands synced with github actions?
Migrations system? Just hard coded for documentation the migrations in /migrations for now.
Docker required to go full release hooked up with github actions, with migrations and all?

**Automated Unit Tests**

**Dockerize**
go app
mysql
redis

**Backup system**

**Maintanence Mode**
System for putting the site in maintanence mode. Probably never needed, maybe cool to make.

**Compartmentalize**
Create a new repo that takes this web framework where a user can get it and start working on a website right away.

**Admin Backend Area**
admin area with database tool? can be behind cloudflare auth etc
