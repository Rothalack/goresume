**BIG TODOs**
**logging/error logging**
Something to compile errors and logs into somewhere searchable. Prometheus+Grafana?

**Release System**
Simple and just have releases set up on github?
Go full, have release commands synced with github actions?
Migrations system? Just hard coded for documentation the migrations in /migrations for now.
Docker required to go full release hooked up with github actions, with migrations and all?

**Dockerize**
go app
mysql
redis? not currently needed
redis for storing access_token i think
